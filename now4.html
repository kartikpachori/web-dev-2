Considered to be one of the best cricketers in the world, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the sport.[4] Nicknamed THE KING, due to his dominant style of play and popularity, Kohli holds numerous records in his career across all formats. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade. Kohli has also contributed to Indias successes, captaining the team from 2014 to 2022, and winning the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions trophy.
